## Rationale

After finding myself writing the function `trim-nil` (equivalent to commons-lang's
`StringUtils/trimToNull` function) for the feel-like 1000th time, I decided to
refactor some of my **everyday** used functions into a standalone library.


## Is it production ready?

No.


## Do I use it in production?

Hell yes!


## Would you like to use it but a function is missing?

Open an issue or better yet, send a PR.
